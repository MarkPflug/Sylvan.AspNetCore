This repository is a sibling to the [Sylvan](https://github.com/MarkPflug/Sylvan) repository and is home to libraries specific to ASP.NET Core.

## [Sylvan.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.Csv](docs/CsvFormatter.md)

A library that adds `text/csv` content negotiation for ASP.NET Core web APIs.
Built using on the [Sylvan.Data.Csv](https://github.com/MarkPflug/Sylvan) library, it is faster than the standard JSON formatter.
